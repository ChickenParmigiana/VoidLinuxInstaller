# VoidLinuxInstaller script

**STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT READY YET!**

An attempt to make [my gist](https://gist.github.com/Le0xFF/ff0e3670c06def675bb6920fe8dd64a3) an interactive bash script.

This is also my first attempt to create a bash script, so a lot of errors and stupid stuffs are present inside.

Pull requests are absolutely welcome, just be sure to put proper comments!
